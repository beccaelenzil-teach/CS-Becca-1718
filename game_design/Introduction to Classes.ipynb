    "# Introduction to Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and objects are very powerful programming tools. They make programming easier. In fact, you are already familiar with the concept of classes and objects. A class is a “classification” of an object. Like “person” or “image.” An object is a particular instance of a class. Like “Mary” is an instance of “Person.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects have attributes, such as a person's name, height, and age. Objects also have methods. Methods define what an object can do, like run, jump, or sit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why learn about classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without classes, our Python code to store this data might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Link\"\n",
    "sex = \"Male\"\n",
    "max_hit_points = 50\n",
    "current_hit_points = 50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do anything with this character, we'll need to pass that data to a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def display_character(name, sex, max_hit_points, current_hit_points):\n",
    "    print(name, sex, max_hit_points, current_hit_points)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine creating a program that has a set of variables like that for each character, monster, and item in our game. Then we need to create functions that work with those items. We've now waded into a quagmire of data. All of a sudden this doesn't sound like fun at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, it gets worse! As our game expands, we may need to add new fields to describe our character. In this case we've added max_speed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Link\"\n",
    "sex = \"Male\"\n",
    "max_hit_points = 50\n",
    "current_hit_points = 50\n",
    "max_speed = 10\n",
    " \n",
    "def display_character(name, sex, max_hit_points, current_hit_points, max_speed):\n",
    "    print(name, sex, max_hit_points, current_hit_points)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In example above, there is only one function. But in a large video game, we might have hundreds of functions that deal with the main character. Adding a new field to help describe what a character has and can do would require us to go through each one of those functions and add it to the parameter list. That would be a lot of work. And perhaps we need to add max_speed to different types of characters like monsters. There needs to be a better way. Somehow our program needs to package up those data fields so they can be managed easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definine and Creating Simple Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "A better way to manage multiple data attributes is to *define* a structure that has all of the information. Then we can give that “grouping” of information a name, like *Character* or *Address*. This can be easily done in Python and any other modern language by using a *class*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can *define* a class representing a character in a game:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Character():\n",
    "    \"\"\" This is a class that represents the main character in a game. \"\"\"\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\" This is a method that sets up the variables in the object. \"\"\"\n",
    "        self.name = \"Link\"\n",
    "        self.sex = \"Male\"\n",
    "        self.max_hit_points = 50\n",
    "        self.current_hit_points = 50\n",
    "        self.max_speed = 10\n",
    "        self.armor_amount = 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another example, we *define* a class to hold all the fields for an address:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#Define an address class\n",
    "class Address():\n",
    "    \"\"\" Hold all the fields for a mailing address. \"\"\"\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\" Set up the address fields. \"\"\"\n",
    "        self.name = \"\"\n",
    "        self.line1 = \"\"\n",
    "        self.line2 = \"\"\n",
    "        self.city = \"\"\n",
    "        self.state = \"\"\n",
    "        self.zip = \"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above, **Address** is the *class name*. The variables in the class, such as **name** and **city**, are called attributes or fields. (Note the similarities and differences between declaring a class and declaring a function.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike functions and variables, class names should begin with an upper case letter. While it is possible to begin a class with a lower case letter, it is not considered good practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **def __init__(self):** in a special function called a constructor that is run automatically when the class is created. We'll discuss the constructor more in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **self.** is kind of like the pronoun my. When inside the class **Address** we are talking about *my* name, *my* city, etc. We don't want to use **self.** outside of the class definition for **Address**, to refer to an **Address** field. Why? Because just like the pronoun “my,” it means someone totally different when said by a different person!\n",
    "\n",
    "To better visualize classes and how they relate, programmers often make diagrams. A diagram for the Address class would look the figure below. See how the class name is on top with the name of each attribute listed below. To the right of each attribute is the data type, such as string or integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Address|\n",
    "|---|\n",
    "|name:String|\n",
    "|line1:String|\n",
    "|line2:String|\n",
    "|city:String|\n",
    "|state:String|\n",
    "|zip:String|\n",
    "\n",
    "The class code *defines* a class but it does not actually create an *instance* of one. The code told the computer what fields an address has and what the initial default values will be. We don't actually have an address yet though. We can define a class without creating one just like we can define a function without calling it. To create a class and set the fields, look at the example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "1 | # Create an address\n",
    "2 | home_address = Address()\n",
    "3 |  \n",
    "4 | # Set the fields in the address\n",
    "5 | home_address.name = \"John Smith\"\n",
    "6 | home_address.line1 = \"701 N. C Street\"\n",
    "7 | home_address.line2 = \"Carver Science Building\"\n",
    "8 | home_address.city = \"Indianola\"\n",
    "9 | home_address.state = \"IA\"\n",
    "10| home_address.zip = \"50125\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance of the address class is created in line 2. Note how the class **Address** name is used, followed by parentheses. The variable name can be anything that follows normal naming rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set the fields in the class, a program must use the *dot operator*. This operator is the period that is between the **home_address** and the field name. See how lines 5-10 use the dot operator to set each field value.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very common mistake when working with classes is to forget to specify which instance of the class you want to work with. If only one address is created, it is natural to assume the computer will know to use that address you are talking about. This is not the case however. See the example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Address():\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.name = \"\"\n",
    "        self.line1 = \"\"\n",
    "        self.line2 = \"\"\n",
    "        self.city = \"\"\n",
    "        self.state = \"\"\n",
    "        self.zip = \"\"\n",
    " \n",
    "# Create an address\n",
    "my_address = Address()\n",
    " \n",
    "# Alert! This does not set the address's name!\n",
    "name = \"Dr. Craven\"\n",
    " \n",
    "# This doesn't set the name for the address either\n",
    "Address.name = \"Dr. Craven\"\n",
    " \n",
    "# This does work:\n",
    "my_address.name = \"Dr. Craven\"\n",
    "```\n",
